# Introduction
Hi! I'm Lee Kei Kar, a student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
I expect to learn how to use software frameworks to build scalable and maintainable applications. Iâ€™ll explore design patterns, modular development, and best practices for integrating frameworks into real-world projects. Additionally, I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.
